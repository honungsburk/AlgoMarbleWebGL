# AlgoMarbleWeb

[AlgoMarble](https://github.com/honungsburk/AlgoMarble) is a generative art project i completed in 2021. This is the webgl version of the same code and was used as a proving ground for the AlgoMarble version used in [GenerativeStudios](https://github.com/honungsburk/generative-studios).

## Implementation

It only uses the canvas element and webgl2 it has no other dependencies.

## Running the code

You need to run a erbserver that serves everything in this directory. I recommen using the inbuilt one in vscode called "live server".
